# ML Engineer Tech Test

## Instructions

This project simulates a lightweight MLOps pipeline. The existing code has some structure, but your task is to take it further â€” as if you were productionising a quick prototype left by someone else.

### Your Goals

You don't need to complete every part, but use your time to demonstrate engineering maturity:

- Refactor the current logic into a more modular, testable structure.
- Add simple monitoring logic to detect significant changes in model performance (e.g., if MAE increases noticeably).
- Introduce a minimal approach to versioning models or preparing for schema changes.
- Review and suggest improvements to the CI setup.
- Run and validate the code via Docker or your own method.

### Bonus (Optional)

- Swap in a new model and simulate logging or experiment tracking.
- Propose a retraining plan.
- Comment on batch vs. real-time tradeoffs.

Focus on demonstrating practical, production-aware ML engineering. Clean, tested code and thoughtful design decisions are more valuable than feature completeness.
